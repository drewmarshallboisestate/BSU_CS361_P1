Project 1: Modeling Deterministic Finite Automata

* Author: Steven Lineses, Drew Marshall
* Class: CS361 Section
* Semester: Fall 2022

## Overview

Use an existing Java framework to simulate a deterministic finite automata model.

## Reflection

Write a brief (2-3 paragraph) reflection describing your experience with this 
project. Answer the following questions (but feel free to add other insights): 
- What worked well and what was a struggle?
- What concepts still aren't quite clear?
- What techniques did you use to make your code easy to debug and modify?
- What would you change about your design process?
- If you could go back in time, what would you tell yourself about doing this project?

## Compiling and Using

Compile the program:

`javac fa/dfa/DFADriver.java`

Run the program and provide a test case:

`java fa.dfa.DFADriver ./tests/p1tc1.txt`
